						<h4>Bitcoin Core: P2P</h4> <p>I spend the majority of my time focused on the P2P (peer-to-peer) layer in Bitcoin Core.
						<br> <br>
						Bitcoin introduces an alternative to centralized financial systems because nodes all over the world can participate in validation. The
						consensus layer is what makes this possible- distributed nodes are able to agree on who has how much money through the the blockchain,
						an innovation introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>
						<br> <br>
						In order to validate blocks and transactions, nodes need to be able to send and receive them amongst each other. These are the concerns
						of the P2P network.  The P2P layer is deeply intertwined with the security of the Bitcoin network, but it is difficult to reason about a
						distributed system with 1000s of nodes with different requirements running different versions of software. The combination of tangible
						impact and intellectual complexity keeps me entertained :)
						<br> <br>
						My P2P contributions generally come through some combination of trying to understand and think critically about existing mechanisms,
						contributing changes, reviewing other proposed changes, improving code clarity and documentation, hosting review clubs, and knowledge
						sharing with other contributors. </p>
